This project analyzes the GDP trends of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom over time and builds a predictive model for future GDP values.

Technologies Used:
Pandas: Data manipulation
NumPy: Numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning (Linear Regression)
Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and converting data types.
Data Visualization: Plotted GDP trends for Germany, France, and the UK over the years.
Prediction: Built a Linear Regression model to predict future GDP values based on historical data for Germany.
Evaluation: Used metrics like Mean Squared Error to assess model performance.
